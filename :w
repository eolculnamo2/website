  Hi!, I'm Rob. I like to tinker with code. Welcome to my ugly website. I do a lot of things, but
  ui design is not one of them!
</p>
<p>
  I aspire to be an excellent software engineer. Excellent software engineers are excellent at
  system design, take on hard projects, and learn fast to adapt to the best tools for any job.
</p>
<p>
  My strengths are on the front end, but I enjoy doing back end work when given then chance. The
  entire stack is interesting to me and I'd like to believe that I can be good at both someday.
</p>
<p>
  I'm also passionate about good tools even if they're not widely adopted. I love compile to js
  languages -- especially <a href="https://rescript-lang.org" target="_blank">ReScript!</a>
</p>

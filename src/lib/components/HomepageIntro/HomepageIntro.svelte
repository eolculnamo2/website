<p>Hi!, I'm Rob. I like to tinker with code.</p>
<p>
  I aspire to be an excellent software engineer. Excellent software engineers are excellent at
  system design, take on hard projects, and learn fast to adapt to the best tools for any job.
</p>
<p>
  While most of my professional experience is on the front end, I aspire to work well across the
  stack. I actively seek opportunities at work to stretch myself whenever opportunities present
  themselves.
</p>
<p>
  I'm also passionate about good tools even if they're not widely adopted. I love compile to js
  languages -- especially <a href="https://rescript-lang.org" target="_blank">ReScript.</a>
</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out!</p>
